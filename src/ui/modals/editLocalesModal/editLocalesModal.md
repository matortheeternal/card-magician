# editLocalesModal
This modal provides a form where translators can create and author translations.
Providing the UI in this way instead of requiring the usage of a text editor gives the
application authoritative control of translations, enabling the development of systems
to add new localization keys to previously built localizations. It also makes
localization highly approachable, empowering non-technical users to contribute through
translation.

## Not fully implemented
The "Validate", "Activate", and "Share" actions are not yet implemented. The modal is
still mostly functional for authoring.
